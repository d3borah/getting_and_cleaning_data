This is the course project for the coursera course 
Getting and Cleaning Data 

For the project, I wrote an R script, run_analysis.R, which will injest several raw data files and turn them into tidy aggregated data. 

The raw data should be placed in the /data directory

The output of the script is a file called tidy_aggregated_data.txt
